# Flazetech Data Science Internship - Task Completion Report

## Introduction
Welcome to the summary of my one-month internship at Flazetech as a Data Science Intern. Over the course of this internship, I have engaged in four significant projects aimed at applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems. The projects included:

1. Iris Flower Classification
2. Unemployment Analysis using Python
3. Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
4. Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

In this document, I will provide an overview of each project, the methodologies employed, key findings, and any relevant insights gained during the process.

## 1. Iris Flower Classification
### Objective:
To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying different species of iris flowers based on their features.

### Methodology:
- Utilized the Iris dataset, a commonly used dataset in the machine learning community.
- Employed Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification.
- Conducted data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques.

### Key Findings:
- Achieved an accuracy of over 95% on the test dataset using SVM.
- Identified key features contributing to the classification of iris flowers.

## 2. Unemployment Analysis using Python
### Objective:
To analyze unemployment trends over a specific time period using Python and relevant statistical techniques.

### Methodology:
- Collected unemployment data from reputable sources.
- Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- Applied time series analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends.

### Key Findings:
- Discovered seasonal fluctuations in unemployment rates.
- Identified demographic or regional factors contributing to variations in unemployment.

## 3. Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
### Objective:
To develop a predictive model capable of estimating the price of cars based on their features.

### Methodology:
- Acquired a dataset containing information about various car attributes and their corresponding prices.
- Employed Lasso regression and Linear Regression algorithms for prediction.
- Conducted feature engineering and model tuning to improve prediction accuracy.

### Key Findings:
- Achieved a satisfactory level of accuracy in predicting car prices.
- Identified the most influential features affecting car prices.

## 4. Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
### Objective:
To create a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.

### Methodology:
- Obtained a dataset containing labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails.
- Utilized Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Logistic Regression algorithms for classification.
- Conducted feature extraction from email texts and model training.

### Key Findings:
- Developed a robust spam detection model with high precision and recall rates.
- Identified common patterns and characteristics of spam emails.

## Conclusion
Throughout my internship at Flazetech, I gained valuable hands-on experience in various aspects of data science, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Each project provided unique challenges and opportunities for learning, ultimately contributing to my growth as a data scientist. I am grateful for the opportunity to work on these projects and look forward to applying the skills and knowledge gained in future endeavors.
